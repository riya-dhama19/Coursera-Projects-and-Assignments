# Predicting_Heart_Disease

This Project I did on Coursera Project Network .

Used scikit-learn and Cost Complexity Pruning to build this Classification Tree  which uses continuous and categorical data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to predict whether or not a patient has heart disease

## Objective :

1. Importing data into, and manipulating a pandas dataframe.

2. Identifying and dealing with missing data.

3. Formatting the data for a decision tree, including One-Hot Encoding

4. Pruning with Cost Complexity Pruning

5. Building, evaluating, drawing and interpreting a classification tree

## Structure :

### Task 1: Import the modules

### Task 2: Import the data

### Task 3: Missing Data Part 1: Identifying Missing Data

### Task 4: Missing Data Part 2: Dealing With Missing Data

### Task 5: Format Data Part 1: Split the Data into Dependent and Independent Variables

### Task 6: Format the Data Part 2: One-Hot Encoding

### Task 7: Build A Preliminary Classification Tree

### Task 8: Cost Complexity Pruning Part 1: Visualize alpha

### Task 9: Cost Complexity Pruning Part 2: Cross Validation For Finding the Best Alpha

### Task 10: Building, Evaluating, Drawing, and Interpreting the Final Classification Tree
